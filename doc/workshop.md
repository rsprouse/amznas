# Working with the EGG-D800

## General principles

- The EGG-D800 provides an indirect method of measuring airflow.
- The Rothenberg mask provides some resistance to airflow, creating backpressure inside the mask.
- The mask is divided into oral and nasal chambers.
- The greater the airflow into each chamber, the greater the backpressure.
- The EGG-D800 measure the pressure of each chamber.

## Properties of the Rothenberg mask

- Constructed of silicone.
- Soft and flexible to conform to the face.
- Adult and child sizes.
- The backpressure created in the masks is low and does not affect comfort in speaking.


## Overall workflow

1. Attach the EGG-D800 to the computer.
1. Configure the EGG-D800. Turn on the pressure transducers and set the microphone volume.
1. Prepare an acquisition directory.
1. Record an acquisition.
1. View the acquisition to check for trouble conditions.
1. Repeat the previous two steps until done.
